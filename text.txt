Who We Are
The Teresia Waihuini Foundation (TWF) was established as a heartfelt tribute to our beloved Matriarch, Teresia Waihuini. Her family, deeply inspired by her life of service and dedication, founded TWF to perpetuate her legacy by actively engaging in community development and support.

Our foundation is built upon four core pillars, guiding our efforts to create lasting positive change:

Education: Empowering individuals through access to learning opportunities.

Environment: Promoting sustainability and conservation for a healthier planet.

Leadership and Development: Fostering growth and capacity within communities.

Healthcare and Community Wellbeing: Addressing health needs and enhancing overall community welfare.

We are committed to embodying Teresia Waihuini's spirit of compassion and service in every initiative we undertake.

Our History
The journey of the Teresia Waihuini Foundation is marked by consistent dedication and impactful activities:
